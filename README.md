# Rust-Code-Raider-RCR

This tool is a python program that can help you code raid in the game ***[Rust (2013)](https://rust.facepunch.com/)***.

This program works by opening a GUI which can be interacted with by using the `[INSERT]`, `[PGUP]` and `[PGDN]` (These keybinds can be changed in the code) keys and shows the most common **10,000** codes, the codes can be found **[Here](https://rusttips.com/top-10000-rust-door-lock-codes/)**.

`[INSERT]`: **Toggle from Windowed to Borderless**.

`[PGUP]`: **Go up one key**.

`[PGDN]`: **Go down one key**.
